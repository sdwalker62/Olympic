Olympic
Welcome to Olympic, a modern Reinforcement Learning framework for researchers and practitioners looking for an alternative to Ray. This project is still in active development and can potentially make changes that are not backwards compatable, doing so only when absolutely necessary to the success of the project. We are looking for collaborators willing to help us build a better framework for the Reinforcement Learning community.
